When I was a graduate student, I did face several difficulties in dealing with writing related work and organizing references.

This "Trivial Suggestions" post is the first part of a dual part post of managing citations and writing related work section.  

## Handling Citations
First, install a citation manager.

There are many citation managers such as: Zotero, Mendely, Refworks, etc.

I use Zotero and am happy with it. The chrome plugin is amazing. You can add a citation to an article or to the list of Google scholar articles with a single click.

Here is a decent tutorial on using Zotero: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm0TboOcAuM

Also, check out EndNote - Click (Thanks to Keerthi), which downloads PDFs (which need special access) using your university account.  

### Advantages of using citation managers:

* Organization: You can perform high-level categorize (e.g., into folders) of all the works.

> For instance: I can organize all the works related to bootloaders based on the type of problem they focus on. E.g., `Bootloader` (Top most level) `->` `Defenses`, `Attacks`, etc.

* Interoperability: It can easily port to various formats without reformatting the works. You can dump all your related works by a single button into the desired format and put it into your proposal, paper, etc.

  

## How to search for related work:

First, have answers to at least the following questions:

* What is the problem you are trying to solve?

> E.g., "Finding vulnerabilities in bootloaders", "Helping students learn better programming", "Automatically understanding human emotions from their voice", etc.

Once you know the problem:

-- Find techniques (hopefully, other than yours) people have used to solve it.

-- Find works that show that the problem is important.

* What techniques are you trying to use to solve the problem?

> E.g., "Static analysis", "Fuzzing", etc.

Once you figured out the technique:

-- Find other problems which most commonly use the technique.

-- Find works that introduced the technique.

## How old should the related work be?

How far back (chronologically) should we go to consider a work to be relevant?

This depends on the specific stream and how active is the area of research. E.g., for machine learning, with its ultra-active area of research, anything older than three years can be (or maybe) considered irrelevant.

For system security, I suggest five years. However, this again depends on the specific problem and approach you are trying to use. Maybe you are using a very old approach (say ten years old) for a new problem. In that case, even though the work is old, you should cite the paper proposing the old approach.

In Part 2, we will see how to write a good related work section.
