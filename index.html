	<p>Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name"> Aravind Machiry</span>, a <b>Fifth year PhD student at University of California, Santa Barbara</b> and a recipient of the <a href="https://www.nortonlifelock.com/about/careers/graduate-fellowship">2018 Symantec Research Labs Fellowship</a>. I am interested in all aspects of System security and Program analysis. Currently, I am working on applying static/dynamic program analysis and fuzzing to solve various system security problems. I am also interested in identifying and improving the weaknesses of static program analysis.</p>
	
	<p>My research resulted in various <a href="https://machiry.github.io/software/">Open-source security tools</a> and several <a href="https://machiry.github.io/misc/">Common Vulnerability Exposures (CVEs)</a> in critical system software such as kernel drivers and bootloaders.</p>

	<p> When time permits, I enjoy participating in Computer Security Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions with <a href="https://www.shellphish.net/">Shellphish</a>, and I won <a href="http://shellphish.net/cgc/">third place</a> with the Shellphish CGC team in the autonomous DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge.</p>
	<p>If you want to know more about my research, discuss problems related to the system security or program analysis, or need a workout partner for your <a href="https://www.crossfit.com/">CrossFit WoD</a>, do not hesitate to contact me :)</p>
