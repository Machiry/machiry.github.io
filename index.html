	<p>My advisors <a href="https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~chris/">Prof. Christopher Kruegel</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~vigna/">Prof. Giovanni Vigna</a> guide me
	towards my goal. I am a <b>Fourth year PhD student at University of California, Santa Barbara</b>. Currently, I am working on applying static/dynamic program analysis and fuzzing to improve the security of various components (Operating system, Trusted Execution Environment, etc) of a smartphone. I am also interested in identifying and improving the weaknesses of static program analysis.</p>
	<p>If you want to know more about my research, discuss problems related to the system security or program analysis, or need a workout partner for your <a href="https://www.crossfit.com/">CrossFit WoD</a>, do not hesitate to contact me :)</p>
