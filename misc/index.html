		<p>I occasionally do things which are not directly related to my research, especially when 
		I am bored or after a long <a href="https://www.crossfit.com/">CrossFit</a> workout.</p>
		<h2>Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenges</h2>
		I occasionally play CTFs as part of the Shellphish hacking group and mostly work on Reversing challenges. I also write challenges to other CTFs. 
		<a href="https://shellweplayagame.org/"><h3>iCTF 2017</h3></a>
		<p>It is the world's largest and longest-running educational hacking competition that integrates both attack and defense aspects in a live setting. It is organized by the members of Shellphish.<br>
		I have contributed an <b>exploitation challenge</b> to 2017 iCTF contest.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Challenge Name: rasf</li>
		<li>Binary: <a href="/ctf_challs/rasf">rasf</a></li>
		<li>Flag Id: The flag ID is the file's name in the fdd2 directory. The flag is the second part of the content.
</li>
		</ul>
		<a href="http://ctf.nullcon.net/"><h3>NullCon HackIM 2017</h3></a>
		<p>This is the CTF conducted as part of NullCon - International Security Conference. I developed all the <b>Reversing challenges</b> for this CTF. Following are the challenges, Have fun.</p>
