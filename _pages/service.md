I recognize the importance of giving back and encourage everyone to serve the academic community.

I strive my best to do it and following are a few instances:

### Technical Program Committee

> Reviewing and providing feedback on submitted papers.

#### Conferences

#### Workshops

### Chair

> Organizing (Reviews, Arranging Program, Funding, etc)


### University Service

> Discussion and reviewing various department level proposals

#### Purdue University (ECE Department)
