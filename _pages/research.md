## Embedded Systems Security
____
Internet of Things (IoT) devices or, in general, embedded devices are ubiquitous and are part of our everyday life. 
We have been moving into an ecosystem of having several small, low-powered microcontroller or microcontroller unit (MCU) based devices connected directly to the internet or through a proxy.
The adoption of these small MCU-based devices is growing rapidly and extensively, with an estimated more 
than 50 billion devices.
It is important to ensure that the RTOS and system software that runs as part of these systems
is secure, and we can rely on it to perform the required mission-critical operations.
Furthermore, security vulnerabilities in these systems are likely remotely triggerable.
Similar to other system software, these are developed in unsafe languages, especially C and C++.
Research shows developers using these unsafe languages are prone to introduce security bugs.

In this area, we focus on various areas targeted towards improving the security of embedded systems.

## Securing Continuous Integration Workflows
----
Continuous Integration (CI) has become essential to the modern software development cycle. Developers engineer CI scripts, commonly called workflows or pipelines, to automate most software maintenance tasks, such as testing and deployment.

Developers frequently misconfigure workflows resulting in severe security issues, which can have devastating effects resulting in supply-chain attacks.
The extreme diversity of CI platforms and the supported features further exacerbate the problem and make it challenging to specify and verify security properties across different CI platforms uniformly.
In this area, we aim to addresses the problem by defining the desired security properties of a workflow and developing platform-independent techniques to verify and enforce the security properties.
