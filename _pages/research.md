## Securing Continuous Integration Workflows
----

Continuous Integration (CI) has become essential to the modern software development cycle. Developers engineer CI scripts, commonly called workflows or pipelines, to automate most software maintenance tasks, such as testing and deployment.
Developers frequently misconfigure workflows resulting in severe security issues, which can have devastating effects resulting in supply-chain attacks.
The extreme diversity of CI platforms and the supported features further exacerbate the problem and make it challenging to specify and verify security properties across different CI platforms uniformly. This project addresses the problem by defining the desired security properties of a workflow and developing platform-independent techniques to verify and enforce the security properties.
