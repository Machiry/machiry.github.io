I am an Assistant Professor and a founding member of [Purdue Systems and Software Security (PurS3) Lab](https://purs3lab.github.io/) at Purdue University in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.

I am interested in designing principled yet practical solutions to system security problems.
I work on the problems of vulnerability detection, prevention, and mechanisms for developing secure systems.
My solutions have a flavor of static/dynamic program analysis, fuzzing, type systems, language-based techniques, machine learning, or a combination of the above.

Refer [Research](./research) for current research directions.

My research resulted in various Open-source security tools and several Common Vulnerability Exposures (CVEs) in critical system software such as kernel drivers and bootloaders.
