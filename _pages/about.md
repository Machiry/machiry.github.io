I am an Assistant Professor and a founding member of [Purdue Systems and Software Security (PurS3) Lab](https://purs3lab.github.io/) at Purdue University in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.

__I am looking for interns, PhD students, and Postdocs interested in the areas of Program analysis, vulnerability detection, IoT, Trustzone, Binary Analysis, or in general System Security. Please contact me if you are interested.__

My Research
------
I am interested in all aspects of System security and Program analysis. In particular, I work on applying static/dynamic program analysis and fuzzing to solve various system security problems.
I am also interested in Binary analysis and exploring Machine Learning techniques
to solve various problems with binary analysis.

My research resulted in various Open-source security tools and several Common Vulnerability Exposures (CVEs) in critical system software such as kernel drivers and bootloaders.

When time permits, I enjoy participating in Computer Security Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions with Shellphish, and I won third place with the Shellphish CGC team in the autonomous DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge.
