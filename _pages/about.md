I am an Assistant Professor and a founding member of [Purdue Systems and Software Security (PurS3) Lab](https://purs3lab.github.io/) at Purdue University in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.

I am interested in designing principled yet practical solutions to system security problems.
I work on the problems of vulnerability detection, prevention, and mechanisms for developing secure systems.
My solutions have a flavor of static/dynamic program analysis, fuzzing, type systems, language-based techniques, machine learning, or a combination of the above.

  <p>We currently work on various areas of system security, such as Embedded systems, Bootloaders, static and dynamic program analysis. Refer <a target="_blank" href="https://machiry.github.io/research/">Research</a> for current research directions.</p>
  <p> If you are interested in joining our lab, please do the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Send me a brief <a target="_blank" href="mailto:amachiry@purdue.edu">

My research resulted in various Open-source security tools and several Common Vulnerability Exposures (CVEs) in critical system software such as kernel drivers and bootloaders.
