Hello! I am an Assistant Professor and a founding member of [Purdue Systems and Software Security (PurS3) Lab](https://purs3lab.github.io/) at Purdue University in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.
I am a recipient of the [NSF CAREER award](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2340548), and [Amazon Research award](https://www.amazon.science/research-awards/recipients/aravind-machiry).

I am interested in designing principled yet practical solutions to system security problems.
I currently work on Security threats from AI Accelerators, Rust for Embedded Systems, vulnerability detection, prevention, and mechanisms for developing secure systems.
My solutions have a flavor of static/dynamic program analysis, fuzzing, type systems, language-based techniques, machine learning, or a combination of the above.
